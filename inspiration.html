My interests in IT are diverse and date back many years to the early 90s, when our family received our first PC, I was a somewhat homely child so after playing all the awesome games there was to offer, Commander Keen, DOOM, Wolfenstein3D, I started getting interested in just how these marvels of technology worked, inside and out. (‘including learning how to not dismantle them, and what doesn’t like going where’), so after a few years I began to build my own (*PC’s), was able to ‘correctly’ manage my windows PC, removing Malware and Spyware (which was becoming insanely prevalent, with hardly any laws written regarding what people could and couldn’t do regarding advertising methods) in part; 
becoming ‘Tech-Support’ and my families ‘Network Administrator’ before I even knew what one was.

It was then by chance discovered a wonderful operating system called ‘LINUX’ and something equally as wonderful called ‘open-source software’ and I guess it has just spiraled from there.
